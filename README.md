# Lem-In
Lem-In is a learning project about graphs, optimal flow, and pathfinding.

From a given input graph and a number N of starting lemmings, lem-in finds the best combination of moves to carry all the lemmingfrom their start node to the end node. The main constraint is that each node can only contain one lemming at a time.
The vizualization was made using d3.js's force layout.

Usage :
```
make
./lem-in -e < sample_maps/1_small ; open viz/index.html
```
